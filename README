Installation steps:

1. Tell QMake the location of the QtCreator sources and the QtCreator build.
Assuming the sources of QtCreator are located at "/home/john/qt-creator" and
the build is located at "/home/john/qt-creator-build":

qmake -set QTC_SOURCE /home/john/qt-creator
qmake -set QTC_BUILD /home/john/qt-creator-build

Per default QTC_SOURCE and QTC_BUILD are set to "../qt-creator".

2. Build
qmake
make
make install

The plugin will be installed into the directory specified by QTC_BUILD.
Starting the locally build QtCreator will automatically embed the plugin.
